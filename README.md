# Affine-Transformations
A simple python script using opencv and numpy to demonstrate affine transformations

## What are affine transformations?
At this point, all I can say is they are simple linear transformations and I don't know anything much about them but thanks to [Affine Transformations LeiosOS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Phj6J287o) I understand them a bit better now. 

This is a simple visualization of affine transformations on a square, made using Python, Numpy and OpenCV.
